# Field Measurement

This half a playground for me to learn some GraphQL but also in the back of my head to create a way to dynamically get the measurements needed for Soccer fields (in feet since we are calling it Soccer).

## Proposed Process

1. Select the field type (Official, 9-10, 7-8, Kinder)
2. Present a "standard" field and measurements
3. Allow input the length and width you have to work with
4. Auto adjust the field measurements based on the changes

## Stretch Goals

1. Learn GraphQL (not at all sure how I can try to use this in here since it could be 100% client side)
2. Make it a SPA so we can "install" it on your phone (offline as well)
3. Printable? Maybe? ðŸ˜ƒ
